# AI-Based-Tic-Tak-Toe-Game
⮚AI is a transformative force in various fields, including Playing 
Games. 
⮚ Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used in video games since the 
1950s. 
⮚ No more predictable foes! AI creates cunning opponents that adapt 
to your strategies, making battles more thrilling. 

**OBJECTIVES :** 
⮚ The primary goal is to create an AI that consistently defeats human 
opponents. This requires mastery of basic Tic Tac Toe strategy and 
efficient move evaluation. 
⮚ **Learn and adapt:** Go beyond static algorithms and develop AIs 
that learn from experience. They should adapt their strategies 
based on past games and opponent behavior. 
⮚ **Explore beyond single games:** Consider more complex Tic Tac 
Toe variations or introduce new mechanics. The AI should handle 
diverse scenarios and maintain its winning edge. 
⮚ **Optimize play speed:** In real-time games, fast decision-making is 
crucial. Develop efficient algorithms that analyze potential moves 
quickly without sacrificing quality. 
⮚ **Improved Game Design and Development:** Streamline 
workflows by automating repetitive tasks, allowing developers to 
focus on creative aspects.

             Take a look that the depth is equal the valid moves on the board.

That tree has 11 nodes. The full game tree has 549.946 nodes! You can 
test it putting a static global variable in your program and incrementing 
it for each minimax function call per turn. 
In a more complex game, such as chess, it's hard to search whole game 
tree. However, Alpha–beta Pruning is an optimization method to the 
minimax algorithm that allows us to disregard some branches in the 
search tree, because he cuts irrelevant nodes (subtrees) in search.
